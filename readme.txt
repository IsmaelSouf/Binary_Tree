This coursework contains two parts. In part A we build a library class that implements a binary search tree data structure for storing string data for efficient searching. In the second part B we use the binary search tree class to implement an efficient spell checker.

To use the program a Makefile is provided :

make partA : Build an object file of the BinarySearchTree, then create a library and build against that library the test file provided for the coursework.

make partB : Build an object file of the BinarySearchTree, then create a library and build against that library the spellchecker.

*./SpellCheck to output Misspelled words in both files

make clean : Clean objects files
